# React Router Dom Unexpected Navigation Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Router Dom v6 related to unexpected navigation behavior.  The bug manifests in situations involving nested components or complex route configurations, leading to silent navigation failures, incorrect page rendering, or unexpected UI updates.  The solution showcases how to effectively debug and resolve this issue. 

## Bug Description:

The core problem lies in how React Router handles navigation updates within nested components or under specific route structures.  Navigation might fail silently without throwing errors, resulting in the wrong content being displayed or the UI remaining unresponsive.

## Reproduction Steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Navigate between the Home and About pages. Observe the potential inconsistencies.  

## Solution:

The proposed solution involves carefully checking navigation results, using component lifecycle methods to observe routing changes, and potentially restructuring route definitions for clarity and proper rendering.   Details are provided in `bugSolution.js`.
